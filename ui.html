        <h1>Usage</h1>
        <p>
          After you click "Run Facebook Security Assessment", we will open 4 windows 
          in the background. We use these to scan public information about your profile
          to report to you the numbers of exposed items regarding you in your social surface.
        <p>
          Our advice is simple and manual. It will require you to do it yourself. In future, paid
          versions of this extension may offer the ability to automatically fix your social
          surface exposure. 
        <p>
          The 4 windows are created in the background. You can review the photos and stores you 
          are tagged in and have liked by viewing those windows.
